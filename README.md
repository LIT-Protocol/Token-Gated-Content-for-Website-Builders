# Token-Gated-Content-for-Website-Builders for Gitcoin GR12 Hackathon

Lit Protocol makes it easy to create token or DAO membership gated resources. This is your opportunity to build a plug-in for one or more popular website builders so that website creators can create content gated via on-chain conditions on their web pages without having to use the Lit Protocol SDK or knowing how to code.
