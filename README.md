# Token-Gated-Content-for-Website-Builders for Gitcoin GR12 Hackathon

## Build plugins for unlockable content for website builders (e.g. wordpress, webflow, squarespace)

Lit Protocol makes it easy to create token or DAO membership gated resources. This is your opportunity to build a plug-in for one or more popular website builders so that website creators can create content gated via on-chain conditions on their web pages without having to use the Lit Protocol SDK or knowing how to code.
